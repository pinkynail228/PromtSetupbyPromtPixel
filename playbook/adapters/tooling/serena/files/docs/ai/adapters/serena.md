# Serena Tooling (Optional)

Serena can reduce repeated context discovery. This project keeps Serena optional.

Recommended flow:

1. Install Serena tooling.
2. Register MCP bridge if Codex is used.
3. Verify command shape (`--context codex`, no `--project`).
4. Keep project process valid even when Serena is unavailable.
