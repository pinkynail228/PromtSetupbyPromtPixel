# Cursor Adapter

Adds `.cursor/rules` bridge so Cursor consistently uses universal project docs.

## Serena-first behavior

- Cursor rule bridge instructs the model to use Serena memory/workflow before broad manual code scanning.

## Limitations

- Keep Cursor-specific behavior in this adapter only.
