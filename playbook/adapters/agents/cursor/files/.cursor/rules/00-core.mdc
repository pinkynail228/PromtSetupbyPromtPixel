Follow AGENTS.md in project root.
Use docs/ai/Flow.md for execution lifecycle.
Use docs/ai/templates/plan.md and docs/ai/templates/report.md for task docs.

Serena-first rule:
- If docs/ai/serena-workflow.md exists, execute that workflow first.
- Use Serena memory before broad manual repository exploration.
