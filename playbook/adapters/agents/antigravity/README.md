# Antigravity Adapter

Adds workspace rules bridge for Antigravity-style projects.

## Native interop

- Respects Antigravity phase model: `PLANNING -> EXECUTION -> VERIFICATION`.
- Uses native artifacts (`implementation_plan.md`, `task.md`, `walkthrough.md`) when present.
- Maps universal quality expectations to native workflow instead of overriding it.

## Limitations

- This adapter does not install user-global settings.
