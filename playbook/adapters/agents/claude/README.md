# Claude Adapter

Creates minimal `CLAUDE.md` project memory to point Claude Code to universal project docs.

## Behavior

- CLAUDE bridge references project flow and context workflow docs.
- Favors context artifacts before deep manual exploration.

## Limitations

- Keep provider-specific logic in this adapter only.
