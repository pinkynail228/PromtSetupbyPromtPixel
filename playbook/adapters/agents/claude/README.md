# Claude Adapter

Creates minimal `CLAUDE.md` project memory to point Claude Code to universal project docs.

## Serena-first behavior

- CLAUDE bridge includes Serena-first instruction for context loading.

## Limitations

- Keep this file short and declarative; source-of-truth remains in `AGENTS.md`.
