# Project memory

Follow project rules in @AGENTS.md
Execution flow: @docs/ai/Flow.md
Templates: @docs/ai/templates/plan.md and @docs/ai/templates/report.md

Context-first rule:
- If @docs/ai/context-workflow.md exists, follow it before manual exploration.
- Query project context records first; manual deep scan is fallback-only.
