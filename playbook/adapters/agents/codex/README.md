# Codex Adapter

Adds Codex-specific optional rules while keeping `AGENTS.md` as the primary source.

## Serena-first behavior

- Codex rule bridge instructs the model to use Serena workflow before manual deep repository exploration.

## Limitations

- Codex already works with root `AGENTS.md`; this adapter is optional.
