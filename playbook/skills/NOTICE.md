# Vendored Skills Notice

This repository vendors a baseline set of workflow skills under `playbook/skills/core`.

## Policy

- Baseline skills are shipped for offline/autonomous bootstrap.
- Updates are controlled via `skills.lock.toml` and `refresh-vendored-skills.sh`.
- Keep skill text generic and repository-safe.
