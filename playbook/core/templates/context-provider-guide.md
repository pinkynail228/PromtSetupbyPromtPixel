# Context Provider Guide (Optional)

Purpose: reduce repeated discovery work by loading durable context before manual deep reading.

## Any-provider baseline

1. Activate project/workspace context.
2. Check onboarding or project index status.
3. Load relevant memories/notes/decision records.
4. Only then run targeted repository search.

## Minimal memory format

- Context: where and why.
- Decision: what was chosen.
- Evidence: commands/checks/artifacts.
- Follow-up: remaining risks or TODO.

## Fallback rule

If provider context is unavailable or low-confidence, continue with manual repository exploration and record key findings for future reuse.
