# Context Workflow

Use context systems to reduce rediscovery before broad manual exploration.

## Protocol

1. Start with project/workspace activation in your available context tool.
2. Confirm onboarding or project index status.
3. Load relevant memories/notes/decision records.
4. Use targeted manual search only for unresolved questions.

## Before task

1. Activate project context.
2. Load existing context relevant to scope.
3. Validate assumptions against repository facts.

## During task

1. Record durable decisions and conventions.
2. Capture pitfalls and mitigations.
3. Keep entries concise and factual.

## After task

1. Write a short memory summary (changes, checks, risks).
2. Store follow-up actions.
3. Ensure next contributor can resume with minimal re-reading.
